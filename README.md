Comparing HATEOAS implementations with Jersey, Spring and VRaptor

This test application uses lombok to cut some boilerplate stuff like getters, all fields constructors and so on.

It's not a full REST API. It's just a use case to test HATEOAS support of above listed frameworks.

Please, fork it, test and make your pull request.

Thanks.
